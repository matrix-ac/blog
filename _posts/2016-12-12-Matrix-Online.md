We have setup a <http://matrix.org> home server on the matrix. (This will get confusing fast).

Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.

We have enabled open registration so you can sign up with any supported client. <https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html#clients>. It is also configured to federate with other matrix servers, so you can talk with many other people.

Join us in ```#bios:matrix.ac```
